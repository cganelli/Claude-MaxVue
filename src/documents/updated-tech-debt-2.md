# MaxVue Tech Debt & Issues Tracking

## Current Issues

### **Issue 1: Advanced Processing System - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Complex canvas-based image processing causing performance issues and state bugs  
**Resolution**: Removed broken Advanced Processing Panel, focused on working Foundation + Progressive + Optical Simulation  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - System now uses reliable enhancement stack  
**Impact**: Improved performance, eliminated state bugs, maintained core functionality  

### **Issue 2: Content Targeting - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Vision correction applying to UI elements (buttons, navigation) instead of just content  
**Resolution**: Implemented ContentTargeting utility with comprehensive UI exclusion  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - ContentTargeting successfully excludes UI elements  
**Impact**: Clean separation between content and UI, improved user experience  

### **Issue 3: Optical Simulation Integration - RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Missing depth-of-field effects for enhanced visual perception  
**Resolution**: Created OpticalSimulation utility and integrated into enhancement stack  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Optical simulation provides accommodation assistance  
**Impact**: Improved visual depth perception, enhanced presbyopia assistance  

### **Issue 4: Button Overexposure on Mobile - DEPRIORITIZED**

**Problem**: Buttons still getting enhanced with contrast/brightness filters causing overexposure on mobile devices  
**Current State**: Desktop emergency cleanup works temporarily, mobile buttons remain overexposed  
**Impact**: UI functionality affected, visual artifacts on touch interface elements  
**Priority**: Low (image protection working, core presbyopia assistance functional)  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks (mobile-specific ContentTargeting system)  

**Technical Problem**:
* Mobile buttons use different selectors/classes than desktop
* Touch interface elements not caught by current ContentTargeting filters
* Progressive Enhancement applying to UI elements despite exclusion attempts
* Manual cleanup works but not integrated into automatic system

**Evidence**:
* Desktop: Manual cleanup successful (8 buttons cleaned)
* Mobile: Buttons remain overexposed after Progressive Enhancement
* ContentTargeting excludes images successfully but misses mobile UI elements

**Strategic Decision**: 
* **Deprioritized**: Core presbyopia assistance working (text enhancement functional)
* **Image protection working**: No overexposure of visual content
* **Focus shift**: Maximize presbyopia effectiveness through enhancement optimization
* **Future consideration**: Address after presbyopia optimization complete

## Enhancement Stack Status

### **Current Working System**:
- ✅ **Week 1 Foundation** - Base text sharpening (3.3/10)
- ✅ **Progressive Enhancement** - Focal cues, content-aware, typography (+0.7/10)
- ✅ **Optical Simulation** - Depth-of-field effects (+0.3/10)
- ✅ **ContentTargeting** - UI element exclusion
- ✅ **Button Protection** - Desktop cleanup working

### **Target Effectiveness**: 4.3/10
### **Current Status**: Foundation + Progressive + Optical working reliably

## Future Considerations

### **Mobile UI Optimization**:
* Mobile-specific ContentTargeting filters
* Touch interface element detection
* Responsive enhancement application

### **Performance Optimization**:
* Enhancement caching
* Selective processing
* Progressive loading

### **Accessibility Improvements**:
* Screen reader compatibility
* Keyboard navigation support
* High contrast mode integration

## Notes

* Core presbyopia assistance functionality is working reliably
* Image protection is comprehensive and effective
* Desktop button protection is functional
* Focus should remain on maximizing presbyopia effectiveness
* Mobile UI issues can be addressed in future iterations
