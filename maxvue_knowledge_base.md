# MaxVue Complete Knowledge Base

## **TL;DR - Project Status**
MaxVue is a mobile vision correction app targeting adults 40+ with presbyopia. **Desktop demo is live and working** at https://maxvue-app-testing.netlify.app/content-demo. **Next priority: Mobile calibration optimization** - user can see clearly at 0.0D on mobile vs. +2.0D which should be needed based on real-life reading glasses use.

---

## **üéØ Project Overview**

**Product:** MaxVue - Vision correction app for presbyopia without reading glasses  
**Target Users:** Adults 40+ with mild vision issues (presbyopia, myopia, astigmatism)  
**Core Value Prop:** Optical correction simulation through personalized filters, not just magnification  
**Current Stage:** Desktop demo complete, mobile calibration needs optimization  
**Timeline:** ASAP (no specific deadline)

**Key Differentiator:** MaxVue provides actual optical correction simulation, not just accessibility features

**What Makes MaxVue Different:**

1. **Real Optical Correction vs. Simple Magnification**
   * MaxVue applies actual diopter-based lens correction (+0.00D to +3.5D)
   * Built-in accessibility just makes things bigger without fixing focus
   * It's like wearing glasses vs. using a magnifying glass

2. **Advanced Image Processing**
   * Unsharp mask filtering, edge enhancement, Sobel operators
   * Canvas-based correction with presbyopia-specific algorithms  
   * Built-in tools just zoom or change text size

3. **System-Wide Application**
   * Works across ALL apps and content simultaneously
   * Built-in accessibility requires app-by-app setup and doesn't work everywhere
   * Persistent overlay that doesn't break app layouts

## **‚öôÔ∏è Configuration**

**Environment Variables (Netlify):**
- **Supabase URL:** `https://cosmgfkxekfsxqipwlii.supabase.co`
- **Supabase Anon Key:** Configured (hasAnonKey: true in logs)
- **Auth Token Storage:** `sb-cosmgfkxekfsxqipwlii-auth-token`

**Planned Integrations:**
- ElevenLabs API keys (voice commands)
- Stripe keys (payment processing)

**Storage Configuration:**
- **Primary:** localStorage for user settings

## **üö® Current Issues**

**Active Problems:**
1. **Mobile Calibration Mismatch:** User can see clearly at 0.0D on mobile slider vs. expected +2.0D based on real-life reading glasses prescription
2. **Distance Adjustment Needed:** Desktop calibration assumes 21-24" viewing distance, mobile typically 12-16"

**Debugging Approach:**
- **Logging Pattern:** Emoji-prefixed console logs (üîç, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå, üéØ, üìä)
- **Component Tracking:** Detailed prop change logging in WorkingCameraDemo
- **Storage Debugging:** Hybrid storage logs for localStorage operations

**Performance Considerations:**
- Need to investigate current performance bottlenecks
- Battery impact optimization for mobile
- Frame rate optimization for real-time correction

## **ü§î Technical Decisions Made**

**Framework Choices:**
- **Vite over Create React App:** Decision made by previous AI assistance
- **Vitest over Jest:** Decision made by previous AI assistance  
- **React + TypeScript:** Type safety and component-based architecture
- **Supabase over Firebase:** PostgreSQL and better developer experience

**Vision Correction Approach:**
- **Initial:** CSS blur filters (suggested by ChatGPT)
- **Current:** Enhanced VisionCorrectionEngine available with:
  - Contrast/brightness enhancement instead of blur
  - Canvas-based unsharp masking
  - Edge enhancement using Sobel operators
  - Text-size aware correction

**Architectural Trade-offs:**
- **localStorage vs Database:** Chose localStorage for speed, Supabase for backup
- **CSS vs Canvas Processing:** CSS for simplicity, Canvas available for advanced correction
- **Client-side vs Server-side:** Client-side for real-time performance

## **üîß Current Vision Correction Implementation**

**Working System (Desktop):**
- **Calibration Range:** 0D to +4D (0.25D steps)
- **Baseline:** +2.0D at 21-24" viewing distance
- **Current Method:** CSS blur filters (`filter: blur(Xpx)`)
- **Formula:** `Math.abs(readingVision - calibration) * 0.5`
- **Storage:** localStorage with keys like `rx_sphere_od`, `calibration_level`

**Mobile Adjustments Available:**
- ‚úÖ **Mobile Detection:** FULLY COMPLETED with `useMobileDetection.ts`
- **Mobile:** +0.75D adjustment for 14" viewing distance (needs implementation)
- **Tablet:** +0.25D adjustment for 18" viewing distance (needs implementation)
- **Desktop:** 0D adjustment for 22.5" viewing distance (working)

**Enhanced Engine Ready:**
‚ùå **Current Problem:** CSS blur makes text MORE blurry (wrong for presbyopia)  
‚úÖ **Solution Available:** VisionCorrectionEngine with proper optical correction
